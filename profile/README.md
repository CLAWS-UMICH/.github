## About Us
**We are building Augmented Reality for NASA astronauts!** The University of Michiganâ€™s CLAWS (Collaborative Lab For Advancing Work in Space) Team is a multi-disciplinary group of undergraduate and graduate students that has competed in the NASA SUITS Challenge since 2018. CLAWS consists of 60 students from a broad set of majors working on research, design, business, and development for space exploration.

### The SUITS Challenge
NASA SUITS challenges university teams to build spacesuit information displays within augmented reality (AR) environments. These holographic interfaces aim to assist astronauts exploring the lunar surface during future Artemis missions. At the end of the school year, teams are invited to the Johnson Space Center for Test Week, where designs are tested and evaluated by NASA designers, scientists, engineers, and astronauts.
